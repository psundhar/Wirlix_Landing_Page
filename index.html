        <h2> Stanford University </h2>
        <p>We are looking at Stanford’s campus to launch a live debate targeting massive general controversies
            relating to the students on campus. We are
            working with a few incredible Stanford students right now to host
            a massive and controversial debate for you and your peers at
            Memorial Auditorium on campus. Think Peter Theil vs. The Fountain Hopper, The Review vs.
            Administration, a debate on the economic issues on campus or more general topics such as
            Trump, Race, etc.  </p>

        <div style="float:right; width:50%; ">
        <h2>Boston College</h2>
        <p> We are gaining traction at Boston College by promoting a movement
            to speak up about the underlying tensions between the conservative administration and
            liberal students. Boston College almost expelled five of their students for having a protest
            against lack of racial diversity on campus, while they failed to publicly apologize or even ackowledge
            an incident when a student wrote "Fag" in graffitti on campus. They also fail to provide birth control
            to students.
            All these incidents, totaled together, cause much controversy on campus and Wirlix is working to
            conduct a debate bringing these issues to light and empwering students and administration to come together
            speak up and initate progress on the Boston College Campus.</p>
