            A black man got beat up by a white man. That's not the headline you are used to seeing
            in the news. That's not the thought that occurs in your head when you think of a
            beating or a fight. However, yesterday, my friend's dad was driving an Uber and got
            assaulted by a passenger. This event in itself is ridiculous and unnecessary hatred but
            what makes this event so horrible and so wrong is that my friend's dad, a kind hearted
            black male, felt that he couldn't fight back because it would then become his fault.
            And on top of all this, he was then yelled at by police men and told he wasn't
            ‘hurt enough.’ All this because he was black. Imagine being punched and feeling
            like you can't defend yourself because your color prohibits it. Imagine being
            labeled by society not for who you are but just for the negative stereotypes that
            come with being you.
            <br />
            <br />

            But what the stereotypes don't tell you is that my friend's dad let me
            stay with him while I was in Boston. He offered me food and made me feel welcome.
            He was kind enough to wake up at 5 AM to drop me to my train versus have me take an Uber.
            I wish this same man felt equal enough to defend himself yesterday. He is not a
            thug or dangerous in any way, yet this is the type of struggle that lives
            within in a black man's soul and haunts him. Teenagers, young children, etc.
            If this was your child, sister, brother or father how would you feel?
            How would you feel knowing in the situation where they were being assaulted,
            compromised, or accused they would not get justice. In fact they would get
            the opposite. We create and condone this society by not speaking up and
            not doing anything to change what we see. My friends dad was not beat to
            pulp and he lived but this small incident represents a culture and norm that affects
            millions everyday.

            He will be traumatized from today and he will never be the same because of
            this attack. How many people need to die and get hurt for
            us to see we need to take a stand?
            <br />
            <br />
